% Function to calculate the condensed stiffness matrix
% Inputs:
% K: is a matrix that represents the stiffness matrix
% p: vector that contains the DoF considered as primary
% s: vector that contains the DoF considered as secondary
% Outputs:
% Ke: condensed stifness matrix
function Ke = condense_K(K,p,s)
% We split the matrix
Ktt = K(p,p);
Kt0 = K(p,s);
K0t = K(s,p);
K00 = K(s,s);
% We compute the condensed or equivalent matrix
Ke = Ktt - Kt0*inv(K00)*K0t;
end
